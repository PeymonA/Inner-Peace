# Inner PEACE

Inner PEACE is a mobile application that aims to support children who have difficulties focusing due to symptoms of anxiety or ADHD. 
Our vision for Inner PEACE is for it to be used as a tool to help children refocus themselves when needed. 
Key features include a game component, music component, breathing component, and a stats component.


Inner PEACE is designed to be used on android tablets.

## Future Plan

- Smartwatch Integration: A feature that we look to implement in the future is to be able to connect the app with a smartwatch. This will allow us to track specific metrics including the heart rate of the user as they are using the app which could provide us further insights.
- Difficulty Settings: The game could include difficulty settings. The difficulty settings could account for both slower and faster players outside the assumed threshold of reaction time in the base game.
- Enhanced Music Section: The music section could include a larger selection of songs and allow songs to keep playing in the background after exiting the music section. Both these features would enhance the music section and may improve user experience.
